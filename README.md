### General overview

Knowledge on what we (donâ€™t) know is crucial for guiding decision making
for the natural systems conversation and restoration. This projects aims
to provide enough description on how we map and analyse the Cerrado tree
wood density trait knowledge gap and ways to palliative overcome it
through permutation.

### Methods rapid description

We used Web of Science, Scielo and grey literature (dissertation and
thesis) to gather data for the cerrado tree wood density trait. Basic
and aparent wood density were used to represent cerrado tree trait gap
and further used in permutation analysis.

### Results

We find that there is no trait data on more than 60% of the cerrado tree
species in the literature. \## References
